Pierre Terblanche, formerly of Ducati and Moto Guzzi among other companies, headed Royal Enfield's design team during development of the Himalayan.";
	private String moreInfo="The Himalayan has a half-duplex split cradle frame. Suspension is telescopic in the front while the rear is provided with monoshock suspension. Front forks are 41 mm with 200 mm of travel and the rear suspension offers 180 mm of travel. The motorcycle has a ground clearance of 220 mm.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Factory standard tyres measure 90/90 21-inch at the front and 120/90 17-inch at the rear. These are manufactured by CEAT. For units sold in the UK and North America, the tyres are manufactured by Pirelli (MT-60).\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The motorcycle has a 300 mm disc with a dual piston floating caliper at the front and a 240 mm single piston caliper disc at rear.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The instrumentation console for this motorcycle is also modeled anew. It includes an analog speedometer and tachometer, with a digital display for the odometer, gear position indicator, trip-meter and Ambient temperature gauge. Also included is an analog fuel gauge and a digital compass.[8] Also included is a windscreen, which can be manually adjusted for height via screws to two positions.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The motorcycle was designed specifically with touring in mind and features an up-right seating position, with a seat height of 800 mm, allowing the rider to be seated relatively low compared to the overall height of the motorcycle. The motorcycle also features mounts on either sides of the tank, which can serve as holders for jerrycans, as well as tank guards. The rear includes a luggage carrier, and mounts are also provided as well to install aluminium panniers, both provided by Royal Enfield as accessories.[9]";
