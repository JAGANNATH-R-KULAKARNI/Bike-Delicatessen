	private String littleInfo="Powering the FZ-X is the identical 149cc engine that’s found in other 150cc FZ models. As a result, it’s no surprise that it makes the same power and torque numbers at the same rpms. The air-cooled, two-valve, SOHC engine produces 12.4hp at 7,250rpm and 13.3Nm at 5,500rpm, which are the lowest figures in the 150-160cc segment. The bore and stroke of 57.3mm x 57.9mm and compression ratio of 9.6 :1 also remains the same. This engine uses a five-speed gearbox.";
	private String moreInfo="While the styling and block pattern tyres might suggest that this is some sort of a retro scrambler, underneath the new bodywork, the FZ-X and FZ are the same. Much like the Honda CB350RS, this bike may have some off-road design cues, but it is a pure road bike.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The motorcycle employs a single downtube frame, suspended by a telescopic fork and preload adjustable monoshock. What this means is that one cannot expect a very different riding experience. The FZ-X also has a kerb weight figure of 139kg, which makes it 2kg heavier than the FZS and 4kg heavier than the standard FZ. This isn’t a good thing because the 150cc FZ range already has one of the lowest power-to-weight ratios in its class.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The FZ-X will have a different riding position\r\n"
			+ "Yamaha has made some significant changes to the FZ-X as far as styling is concerned. Along with those changes, it also appears as if the company has made tweaks to the riding position. A quick look at the specifications sheet reveals that the flat seat on the FZ-X is 20mm higher than that of the other 150cc models. Also evident is the raised handlebar. While we haven’t yet had the chance to experience the FZ-X, the pictures do convey that this motorcycle will indeed have revised ergonomics.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Yamaha Connect features\r\n"
			+ "Yamaha has launched the FZ-X in two variants and the more expensive one (Rs 1.20 lakh) features Bluetooth connectivity. This variant will allow you to pair your smartphone via the Yamaha Connect application to enable features like call and SMS alerts and more. While this system does have a unique feature where it allows you to compare your fuel efficiency data with other Yamaha owners, it misses out on turn-by-turn navigation.\r\n"
