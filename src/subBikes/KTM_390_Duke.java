It's as agile in traffic as a push-bike and whippet-thin,\" saying the bike was ideal for young riders with the A2 license, limited to 47 bhp (35 kW), who would find it easy to ride and confidence-inspiring, while feeling \"fast and sporty\".[2] Such a bike in the UK would also appeal to experienced riders looking for a practical and efficient commuter bike and runabout.[2] The 390 Duke won the 2013–14 Jury's Choice Bike of the Year in The Bloomberg TV India Autocar India Awards.[17] IndianCarsBikes said that with a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) and a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) time of 5.5 seconds, the 390 Duke is the fastest motorcycle made in India as of January 2014.[18]\r\n"
